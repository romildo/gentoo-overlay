# Personal Gentoo Overlay

This is my personal overlay where I keep Gentoo ebuilds.

This includes:
- Ebuilds for software that I want to use but could not find a working ebuild for.
- Modified versions of ebuilds from other places, for whatever reason.
- Ebilds for my own personal software projects.

Basically, stuff I care about.

You are free to take my ebuilds from here and do absolutely anything
you want with them. After all, they are just some scripts for building stuff
with a particular distribution's tools.
